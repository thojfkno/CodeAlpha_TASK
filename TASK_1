🔹 STEP : Load Data into Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop

Click “Get Data” > Excel / CSV / SQL / Web depending on your source

Import your prepared financial data sheets

Click Transform Data to open Power Query

🔹 STEP : Clean and Transform Data
In Power Query Editor:

Rename columns meaningfully

Format data types (e.g., Date columns, Currency for Amount)

Split columns if needed (e.g., Year from Date)

Remove null/empty rows

Create new calculated columns (like Net Profit = Revenue - Expenses)

Then click Close & Apply

🔹 STEP : Create Data Model & Relationships
Go to Model View (left side tab)

Define relationships between:

Time Table ↔ Income Statement

Time Table ↔ Balance Sheet

Department/Account Type tables if any

Use Date Table (create one if needed: “Modeling > New Table”)

DAX

DateTable = CALENDAR(DATE(2020,1,1), DATE(2025,12,31))
🔹 STEP : Create Financial KPIs with DAX
In “Modeling” tab, create measures like:

DAX

Total Revenue = SUM('Income Statement'[Revenue])
Net Profit = SUM('Income Statement'[Net Income])
Gross Margin % = DIVIDE([Gross Profit], [Revenue])
Current Ratio = DIVIDE(SUM('Balance Sheet'[Current Assets]), SUM('Balance Sheet'[Current Liabilities]))
🔹 STEP : Design the Dashboard Pages
✅ 1. Executive Overview
KPI Cards: Revenue, Net Profit, Cash Flow, Current Ratio

Line Chart: Revenue vs Profit trend

Slicers: Date, Department

Line/Bar chart for Revenue, COGS, Profit over time

Pie chart for Expense Category

✅ 3. Balance Sheet

Enable Forecast, set time period and confidence level

You can also use DAX for basic linear projections.

🔹 STEP : Add Interactivity and Navigation

Add Drill-through pages: From high-level KPIs to specific accounts or departments

Use Bookmarks and Buttons for navigation

🔹 STEP : Polish the Dashboard
Use consistent color themes (green for profit, red for loss)

Name all visuals and pages clearly

Hide unused fields in field pane

Add tooltips for charts to show extra info

Check layout responsiveness

🔹 STEP : Save & Publish
Save as .pbix

Publish to Power BI Service → Share via web/app
