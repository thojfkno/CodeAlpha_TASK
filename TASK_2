Step-by-Step Procedure
🔹 STEP 1: Prepare Your Dataset
You need data in structured format such as Excel, CSV, SQL Server, etc.
Recommended data tables:

🗂️ 1. Employee Master Table
EmployeeID	Name	Department	DateOfJoining	Status (Active/Left)	Gender	Age	JobLevel

🗂️ 2. Recruitment Data
| CandidateID | JobTitle | ApplicationDate | InterviewDate | OfferDate | HiredDate | Status (Hired/Rejected) |

🗂️ 3. Exit Survey or Turnover Data
| EmployeeID | ExitDate | ExitReason | Tenure (Months) | Department |

🗂️ 4. Employee Satisfaction
| EmployeeID | SurveyDate | SatisfactionScore (1–5) | Comments |

🗂️ 5. Performance Ratings
| EmployeeID | Year | Rating (1–5) |

🔹 STEP 2: Import Data to Power BI
Open Power BI Desktop

Click Home > Get Data > Excel/CSV

Import all relevant tables

Click Transform Data to clean:

Ensure date types are correct

Remove nulls

Standardize department names

🔹 STEP 3: Create Relationships in Model View
EmployeeID → link across tables

Date fields → use a Date Table (recommended for forecasting)

DAX
Copy
Edit
DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN(Employee[DateOfJoining]), MAX(Employee[ExitDate]))
🔹 STEP 4: Create DAX Measures
✅ Recruitment Metrics
DAX
Copy
Edit
Total Applications = COUNT('Recruitment'[CandidateID])
Hires = CALCULATE(COUNT('Recruitment'[CandidateID]), 'Recruitment'[Status] = "Hired")
Hire Rate % = DIVIDE([Hires], [Total Applications])
✅ Turnover Metrics
DAX
Copy
Edit
Leavers = CALCULATE(COUNT('Employee'[EmployeeID]), 'Employee'[Status] = "Left")
Turnover Rate % = DIVIDE([Leavers], COUNT('Employee'[EmployeeID]))
✅ Satisfaction & Performance
DAX
Copy
Edit
Avg Satisfaction Score = AVERAGE('Satisfaction'[SatisfactionScore])
Avg Performance Rating = AVERAGE('Performance'[Rating])
🔹 STEP 5: Build the Dashboard
🟦 Page 1: Executive Summary
KPI Cards: Headcount, Turnover %, Avg Satisfaction, Avg Rating

Line Chart: Headcount Trend

Bar Chart: Employees by Department

🟨 Page 2: Recruitment Funnel
Funnel Chart: Applicants → Interviewed → Hired

Line Chart: Hires over Time

KPI: Hire Rate %

🟥 Page 3: Turnover Insights
Column Chart: Turnover by Department

Pie Chart: Exit Reasons

Histogram: Tenure of Exited Employees

🟩 Page 4: Employee Satisfaction
Slicer: Department

Line Chart: Satisfaction over Time

Donut Chart: Satisfaction Score Distribution

🟪 Page 5: Performance & Forecasting
Bar Chart: Ratings Distribution

Forecast Chart: Predicted Hiring Needs

What-if Parameter: Expected Attrition

🔹 STEP 6: Add Interactivity
Use slicers for Department, Year, Gender, Job Level

Enable tooltips to show extra info on hover

Add drill-through pages from KPIs to individual-level details

🔹 STEP 7: Polish & Publish
Apply a consistent theme

Rename all visuals

Save as .pbix

Publish to Power BI Service and share with HR team

Optionally, use Power BI Gateway for data refresh
